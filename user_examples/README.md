User Customization Examples
===========================

Users can customize their epics-containers developer containers by creating
the files in this folder into their home directory and customizing them as
required.

epics-containers .devcontainer configuration will automatically pick up
these files from the home directory.

- .bashrc_dev_container: runs on start of every new shell in the container.
- /bashprofile_dev_container: runs once immediately after the creation
  of a devcontainer.
